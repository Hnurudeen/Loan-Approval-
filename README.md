# Predicting Loan Approval with Backpropagation Neural Networks (BPNN) üè¶üß†



## üìù Description  
This project predicts loan approval status (Approved/Rejected) using **Backpropagation Neural Networks (BPNN)** and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**. Key highlights:  
- **97.19% accuracy** with BPNN vs. 93.44% with SVM.  
- Automated feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.  
- Critical insights into factors like `luxury_assets_value` and `cibil_score`.

*Over the heatmap above, it is shown that the variable that affects the loan_status the most is cibil_score.
It is also proved there is no variable that has a linear relationship with the education and self_employed.
There are strong linear relationship between income_annum & loan_amount, luxury_assets_value & income_annum, bank_asset_value & income_annum and luxury_assets_value & bank_asset_value*
